# AdventOfCode
This project and repository is my main project for solving the daily Advent of Code puzzles that come up every December.

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can 
 be solved in any programming language you like."

All solutions are completed in C# and many of the supporting libraries that assist with reading/parsing inputs and apply
common algorithms to puzzles were build from the ground up with some pointers from other coders that have participated
in this daily puzzle.

Developer Tools required: Visual Studio 2022 w/ .NET Core 6.0
